</pre>
                     <p> Alternatively to client.sh, to launch many clients at the same time and populate the DB quicker:</p>

> clients10.sh
</pre>
                     <p> if you want to try the blacklist, launch a client with username "blacklisted":</p>

                     <p>Server offers service for player wallet (balance). Wallet state (balance) should be managed in memory (3rd party solution may not be used). Balance is backed up in database (hsql). When balance is not in memory, it is loaded from database and any changes are done in memory.

                        <li>  If player is in blacklist, then change is denied (explained further below).</li>

                        Client itself is a server that offers gameplay logic. Specific gameplay will not be implemented, client can just generate random balance updates. Specific communication protocol between client and server is not specified (custom protocol can be invented). Server must write proper log information, where at least IN/OUT per player must be grep’able.

                           <pre>Server offers service for player wallet (balance). 
Wallet state (balance) should be managed in memory (3rd party solution may not be used). 
Balance is backed up in database (hsql). 
When balance is not in memory, it is loaded from database and any changes are done in memory. 
</pre>
                           <p>It is loaded in a Hashmap called activeUsers with username as key and a userwallet object as a value, the latter gets filled from database and modified according to what gets received by the client.</p>

                        <li>
                           <pre>Player record in database is created on demand. 
There is a periodical background process to write changes from memory to database.
</pre>
                           <p>A new user is always backed up in database as soon as he sends his first message.
                              He gets backed up also when the connection is closed and periodically after an adjustable number of transactions (see Settings.TRANSACTIONS_NUMBER_BEFORE_COMMIT).
                              Furthermore there is a periodical background process (inner class BlackListUpdater) dealing with the blacklist, whose delay is also adjustable (see Settings.BLACKLIST_CHECK_MSEC)
                           </p>
                        </li>

</pre>
                           <p>This never happens from the client: it's clever enough to never bet an amount he doesn't have.
                              In case he would, the server is programmed to get to 0 and send him an error code (see Settings.ERROR_CODE_INSUFFICIENT_BALANCE).  
                           </p>
                        </li>

Check may take into consideration only 1000 latest transactions.
</pre>
                           <p>Client and server must align to the same sequentially increasing ID starting from 0 each session, if the client resends an old one, the server will send him 
                              the balance with related error code and no balance change (see Settings.ERROR_CODE_RESEND).
                              The client can be adjust to resend previous transactions (see Settings.CLIENT_MIGHT_RESEND).

</pre>
                           <p>Blacklist has its own database table checked periodically and every time a new user connects.
                              In case of blacklisted user, the connection gets ended and I have implemented a specific exception where any further behaviour can be introduced.

                           <p>From database tables in my case, one for balance and one for blacklist. </p>

OUT: what server sends to client
OFF: a user/client has left

                           <p>
                              you can see how its balance gets updated if you sum up the last number to the 
                              second last of the next line (0+17=17, +25=42, +16=58, etc.).
                              Sometimes the sum is wrong just because some lines are balance check only, and 
                              this happens when you have the number 22 in the fourth field and the transaction 
                              number is repeated from the previous line in the third field.
                              <br>Other examples:
